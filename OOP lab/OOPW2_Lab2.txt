OOP W2 Lab 2 C++

Prepared by Dr Han Duy Phan.

Requirements:
Improve the simple C++ student management program from Lab 1. For this week you need to keep the information of each student's name and their score in two separate dynamically allocated arrays using pointers.
DONE(1) Use C++ dynamic array data structure using pointers to store two lists of all students' names and students' scores, 1 list for students' names & 1 list for student' scores.
DONE(2) Implement a function that allows users to add a new student and the corresponding score to the two above lists.
DONE(3) Implement a function to display the list of all students and the scores.
DONE(4) Implement a function to display the best student(s)'s name(s) and their score(s) (there could be more than one student who have the same highest score).
DONE(5) Use C++ WHILE loop to create a text-based menu that allows users to choose the above functionalities or to exit the program.

Submission: 
Create a zip file of all your .cpp and .h project files.
Make sure to name your zip file using the following format
[StudentID]_[StudentFullName]_[ClassName]_Lab1.zip
Submit your zip file before the deadline using the corresponding link on Moodle for your class (each class has a different deadline).

Marking criteria: 
Each lab is worth 3% of total mark.
