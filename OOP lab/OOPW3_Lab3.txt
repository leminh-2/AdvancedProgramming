OOP W3 Lab 3 C++

Prepared by Dr Han Duy Phan.

Requirements:
Improve the simple C++ student management program from Lab 2. For this week you need to keep the information of each student's name and score in a class and maintain the list of student objects in a dynamically allocated array using pointer.

DONE (1) Create the Student Class that stores name and score. Make sure to have constructor and destructor.

DONE (2) Use C++ dynamic array data structure using pointers to store a list of all the student objects.

DONE (3) Implement a function that allows users to create and add a new student object to the list of students (remember to use constructor through 'new' keyword).

DONE (4) Implement a function to display the list of all students and the scores.

DONE (5) Implement a function to display the best student(s)'s name(s) and their score(s) (there could be more than one student who have the same highest score).

DONE (6) Implement a function to remove a student from the list based on the name input (remember to use destructor through 'delete' keyword)

DONE (7) Use C++ WHILE loop to create a text-based menu that allows users to choose the above functionalities or to exit the program.

Submission: 
Create a zip file of all your .cpp and .h project files.
Make sure to name your zip file using the following format
[StudentID]_[StudentFullName]_[ClassName]_Lab3.zip
Submit your zip file before the deadline using the corresponding link on Moodle for your class (each class has a different deadline).

Marking criteria: 
Each lab is worth 3% of total mark.
No attempt 0 mark, serious attempt 1 mark, working attempt 2 marks, good attempt 3 marks.
